Beam Single-Spin Asymmetry Analysis

This file outlines the scripts used for asymmetry analysis. The main changes include:
- The replay script records the helicity state of each event
- The report file contains detector efficiencies for each helicity state independantly
- The analysis script splits output into positive and negative helicity trees

To be added later:
- Scripts for PID, t-binning, the actual asymmetry calculation, and fitting
- Analysis batch script (doesn't work yet)
