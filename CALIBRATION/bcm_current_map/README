This script runs over a scaler tree (TSH) and save bcm current values
for BCM1, BCM2, (BCM4a, BCM4b, BCM17) as well as the event number 
for each scaler event.

How to make a parameter file for the average BCM current information

- Use ROOT version 6.08 to use R__LOAD_LIBRARY
- Do this once to make shared libraries (or after modifying the marco)
> root -b
root [0] .L ScalerCalib.C+

To run a script:
> root -b
root [0] .x run.C("/path/Scaler root output file");

It prints out 
      # of scaler read, 
      average bcm current values for each bcm
      corresponding event number for each scaler event
