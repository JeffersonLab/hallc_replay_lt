This script runs over a scaler tree (TSH) and save bcm current values
for BCM1, BCM2, (BCM4a, BCM4b, BCM17) as well as the event number 
for each scaler event.

How to make a parameter file for the average BCM current information

- Use ROOT version 6.08 to use R__LOAD_LIBRARY
- Do this once to make shared libraries (or after modifying the marco)
> root -b
root [0] .L ScalerCalib.C+

To run a script:
> root -b
root [0] .x run.C("/path/Scaler root output file");

It prints out 
      # of scaler read, 
      average bcm current values for each bcm
      corresponding event number for each scaler event

# C.Y. Comment (Aug 27, 2021)
# For some reason when I compile the code in root: >> .L ScalerCalib.C+
# The relevant .so and .pcm files are actually save to
# /home/cdaq/.root_build_dir/home/cdaq/pionLT-2021/hallc_replay_lt/CALIBRATION/bcm_current_map/
# but they don't show up in dir:  ~/pionLT-2021/hallc_replay_lt/CALIBRATION/bcm_current_map/
# I had to copy the files manually, then I was able to do: .x run("ROOTfile_path") to create the param file,
#
