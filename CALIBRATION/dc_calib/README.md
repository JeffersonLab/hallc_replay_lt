HMS/SHMS Drift Chambers Calibration
============================================
This directory contains the code for calibrating the pair of HMS/SHMS drift chambers.

Directory structure
----------------------
* hallc_replay/CALIBRATION/dc_calib/scripts/main_calib.C   : steering C++ code that executes the methods in DC_Calib.C
* hallc_replay/CALIBRATION/dc_calib/scripts/DC_Calib.C  : Calibration Code where all the class  methods are defined
* hallc_replay/CALIBRATION/dc_calib/scripts/DC_Calib.h  : Header file containing the variable definitions used in the methods

Running code
---------------
NOTE: p: SHMS,  h: HMS,  <spec>: HMS, or SHMS

* First set the parameter 'p(h)_using_tzero_per_wire = 0' in the 
  parameter file located in: hallc_replay/PARAM/<spec>/DC/p(h)dc_cuts.param

* Replay the data to produce the uncalibrated root file to be used as input in the calibration
  NOTE: Make sure to include the necessary leaves if you want to make any pid cuts.
  NOTE SK 24/10/19 - This isn't actually true, the script does not look at the time but rather the etot norm value instead
                     To add the timing back in this should really look at the correct time for T.coin.* not T.hms/T.shms...
  The leaves are:

      SHMS:
      P.ngcer.npeSum, P.cal.etot, T.shms.pEL_CLEAN_tdcTime (the P.cal.etot is currently commented out until further discussion)
      NOTE - Changed to P.hgcer.npeSum for KaonLT running      

      HMS:
      H.cer.npeSum, H.cal.etot, T.hms.hEL_CLEAN_tdcTime (the H.cal.etot is currently commented out until further discussion)
      

  * From the hallc_replay directory execute: ./hcana SCRIPTS/<spec>/PRODUCTION/<replay_script.C>

* From the directory where this README file is:
  -Open and modify 'DC_Calib obj()' line. This line has the following format:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  	DC_calib obj("<spec_flag>", "/path/to/ROOTfile/", run_NUM, event_NUM, "<pid_flag>");
	
	EDIT - This is stupid, why not just provide these things as arguments to your script? 
	Altered main_calib.C to do this... SK 15/5/19
	Simmply provide Spec_Flag, ROOTfile (full path), run number
	Will add PID flag in as argument soon too for comparison  SK 26/8/19	

	**The <spec_flag> and <pid_flag> have the possible arguments:

	    <spec_flag>: HMS, SHMS

	    <pid_flag>: pid_elec, pid_hadron, dc_1hit, pid_kFLASE

	    When the <pid_flag> is selected, the calibration script applies the following cuts:

	    	 1) pid_elec:  P.ngcer.npeSum > 1.0 && T.shms.pEL_CLEAN_tdcTime > 0.0   (for HMS:  H.cer.npeSum > 1.0 && T.hms.hEL_CLEAN_tdcTime > 0.0 )
		 2) pid_hadron: P.ngcer.npeSum < 1.0  (for HMS:  H.cer.npeSum < 1.0 )
		 3) dc_1hit: Ndata.P(H).dc.plane.time == 1 && Ndata.P(H).dc.plane.wirenum == 1,  where plane-> 1u1, 1u2, ...
		    NOTE: The Ndata cut, requires a single hit in each chamber per plane per event
		 4) pid_kFALSE: No cuts are applied.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	    		

* Once the arguments are specified, execute: root -l main_calib.C

When the calibration is completed, a directory will be created under the name: <spec_flag>_DC_Log_runNUM/

     In this directory, the calibration output files are stored automatically, once the calibration is completed:

     	     1)  <spec_flag>_DC_driftimes.root
	     2) t_zero_values_plane.dat
	     3) p(h)dc_calib_runNUM.param
	     4) p(h)dc_tzero_per_wire_runNUM.param

	     	Each file contains the following:
		     1) uncalibrated/calibrated drift times, fitted drift times, tzero_v_wire graphs
		     2) data files containing four columns: wire, tzero, tzero_error,  entries
		     3) parameter file containing time-to-distance look-up values
		     4) parameter file containing per-wire tzero corrections


* The parameter files must be copied to the following location:

      -> /hallc_replay/PARAM/<spec>/DC/hdc_calib.param
      -> /hallc_replay/PARAM/<spec>/DC/hdc_tzero_per_wire.param

* Set the parameter 'p(h)_using_tzero_per_wire = 1' in the 
  parameter file located in: hallc_replay/PARAM/<spec>/DC/p(h)dc_cuts.param

* From the hallc_replay directory execute: ./hcana SCRIPTS/SHMS/PRODUCTION/<replay_script.C> once again.

NOTE: An indication that the calibration worked is by looking a the drift distances, which should appear
      relatively flat. Not on a per wire basis, plot drift distance for each plane as a 1D hist.
       There may be a high number of counts at the extremes of the drift distance, for which
      the additional cuts may need to be applied.

* The recommended cuts when looking at drift distances are:

      1) P(H).dc.plane.time > 0   (drift time > 0)
      2) PID cuts that were applied based on the <pid_flag> selected
