# Calibrating the Cherenkov
* To automatically run the calibration
```
root -l "run_cal.C(RunNumber,NumEvents,COIN)"
```
* Where COIN == 1 indicates the file was a full coincident replay
* If options are left blank, user will be prompted for a value
* To manually run the scripts:
* Link your ROOT file
* Run the script with options (listed after script is executed)
```
root -l ../../ROOTfiles/hms_replay_488_-1.root
T->Process("calibration.C+", "options");
```
* Or, if you want to run using PROOF
```
root -l
TChain ch("T");
ch.Add("/path/to/ROOTfile");
TProof::Open(""); \\For PROOF-lite, adjust accordingly for PROOF
ch.SetProof();
ch.Process("calibration.C+", "options");
```
### Options for the calibration script are (case/spelling important):
* **showall** - display all calibration details (lots of windows)
