# Information

- This folder contains various scripts and files from the online running, including the online 50k scripts. You'll need to move them out of this folder and into the main hallc_replay_lt folder for them to execute. They also expect the onlineGUI to be setup and compiled.
  - get_coda_photos can be used to get the images from the angle camera, but it must be run on cdaq.
    - See https://hallcweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/Extract_Angle_Cam_Image_from_CODA_files for more info
  - There is also a sym link setup script for cdaq and a spreadsheet that was used to estimate how long a setting would take
