This branch, offline, has all of the scripts as they were at the END of the run on 20/7/19. It will 
also receive future updates to scripts that are applicable to ALL users analysing the Kaon or Pion LT
data.

These scripts execute a hcana replay and then run a quick analysis script on that replay once it ends.
The replay script outputs some plots to the screen, here's some brief notes on what you should expect
to see -

HeepSinglesYield.sh - Plots of the HMS and SHMS W distributions, here we expect these to be peaked at
~0.938. If you see an extra bump in the distribution at ~1.2 this is likely just due to the delta cut
being too open. You'll also get some other plots of phi for the q vector and of W vs x'fp.

HeepCoinYield.sh - A plot of the missing mass, this should be ZERO. You should also see that the missing
momenta (all components) and energy are ZERO.

luminosity.sh - You should see some event selection histograms, what's important here are the numbers
that are also printed to screen detailing the numbers of events. Don't worry about these too much.

PionYield.sh - Here you will see some event selection histograms, some timing histograms and finally a 
summary of the kinematics. The Q2 and W diamond should match up to your current experimental setting.
The value of epsilon should also match up. You should also see a missing mass plot with a peak at the
neutron mass (~0.940). This should have a nice gaussian fit to it, you'll also get a textbox with the 
number of pion events found. Make a note of this number on the run sheet.

NOTE - The scripts are set up such that they will NOT run another replay IF an existing root file exists.
If you want to replay again, comment out the relevant line in each script.
