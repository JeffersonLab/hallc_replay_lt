To do on cdaq -

1. Update hallc_replay_lt (X)
   1a. Cloned and updated online_pionlt (X)
       -> Sym links set up (X)
   1b. Update all submodules (X)
       -> UTIL_BATCH, cloned and online_pionlt updated (X)
       -> UTIL_PION, cloned and online_pionlt updated (X)
       	  -> Sym links set up (X)
   1c. Re-organise PARAM/DB files, set new sym links up as needed, check pathing, clean up ()
       -> hallc_replay_lt (X)
       	  -> Replay scripts (X)
       	  -> DB files (X)
	  -> Param files (X)
	     -> Some detector directories have junk files in them, needs cleaning (X)
	  -> DEF files (X)
	  -> DEF cut files (X)
       -> UTIL_PION ()
       	  -> Analysis scripts(X)
       	  -> Cut DB files (X)
	  -> Cut Param files (X)
	     -> Need to organise and sort this directory, lots of files at the top level, very confusing. Need to sort them ()
   1d. ScalerCalib.C -> Get this working or remove it (X)
       -> Do we even need this? Can skip scaler replay if not (X)
   1e. Remove good soup, freshen memes (X)
2. Get UTIL_OL and online GUI working (X)
3. Test all replay scripts (X)
   3a. Modify running script as needed (X)
4. Check run_PionLT.sh works as expected after changes (X)
5. Merge in Ali's def file and report file updates (see 1c) (X)
   5a. Updated runlist filling script to grab correct variables after changes (X)
       -> No changes were actually needed for now
6. Fixes and updates to DEF/DEF-CUTS/Template files
   -> Need updated computer/EDTM live time calculations. HeePCoin currently uses Production template file, should use its own.
      In modifying thse, should also check quantities calculated and reported actually make sense. E.g. before I fixed it, the
      SHMS HeePSingles report file was producing an SHMS hadron efficiency, here it is set to detect electrons so this makes no
      sense.
   -> Production ()
   -> HeeP Singles ()
   -> HeeP Coin ()
   -> Luminosity ()
   -> Once these are done, reconfirm that the runlist filling script gets the right info ()

To do elsewhere -

1. Update instructions/plots on the wiki ()
